# Web Technology Project - TP1

## Project Description

This project is part of the Web Technology course (M1) and focuses on building a basic web application. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The project starts with creating the basic structure of the web pages using HTML. This includes defining the layout, headings, paragraphs, links, and other essential elements.

2. **Styling with CSS**: Once the HTML structure is in place, CSS is used to style the web pages. This involves adding colors, fonts, spacing, and other design elements to make the web pages visually appealing.

3. **Interactivity with JavaScript**: JavaScript is then used to add interactivity to the web pages. This includes handling user inputs, manipulating the DOM, and creating dynamic content.

4. **Responsive Design**: The project also focuses on making the web application responsive. This means ensuring that the web pages look good and function well on different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Throughout the development process, the project is tested and debugged to ensure that it works as expected. This involves checking for errors, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Start by exploring the HTML files to understand the structure of the web pages.
4. Move on to the CSS files to see how the styling is applied.
5. Finally, check the JavaScript files to understand how interactivity is added.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to web development. By working through the different stages of the project, you will gain a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how they work together to create a functional and visually appealing web application.
